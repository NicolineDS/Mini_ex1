My first independent coding process has been confusing, stressful but also very successful. The reading about the different codes, languages and programs one could use seemed very overwhelming and intimidating at first. But after having watched different videos on how to approach the process and having our first lecture it all seemed a little less terrifying and stressful.
When I had written my first code and a circle appeared on the screen I was filled with joy. It felt like I had discovered a whole new world where only programmers like Mark Zuckerberg usually are allowed. Suddenly I got a look into a world there have been unknown to me. Now a can form an understanding of the work behind different websites and how much work there lies behind.
The codes I used for my first programming experience were all from the P5.js website. I only used very simple codes for my first coding and made my setup for the codes as simple as possible as well. I did this because I am new to coding and there for I want to learn the basis before I start using the more advanced codes. Even though I used very simple codes the modifying of the codes could create moments of confusion and frustration. I spend a lot of my coding time making the legs and arms fit the body for my coded man. This was an issue for me because there are four variables in the code for a line and I could not seem to figure out which variables controlled what. After many attempts I finally got the arms and legs to fit the body, and it truly was a victory.
I think coding is very much like reading and writing text. Coding is like learning a new language where you need to figure out how to construct a sentence so it becomes understandable for the receiver. When you have created a perfect sentence the computer understands what you are trying to tell it and what you whishes’ for it to do.Even though there are many similarities there are also some differences. When humans speak to each other we can also use our body language to communicate, and we can use slang and still be understandable to one another. When you speak to a computer, you need to be very precise and follow specific rules to be understood.
I believe that being able to code creates a lot of opportunities for oneself. As Annette Vee writes in her text “Coding for Everyone and the Legacy of mass Literacy”: “[…] code is an issue of civil rights” the “4th literacy,” and a way to “control your destiny, help your family, your community, and your country.” (Annette Vee, s.2) I believe that coding has the potential to be a way of expressing yourself through technology and a way to take over your own life on the Internet. I consider there for coding having the potential to becoming the literacy of the future.
